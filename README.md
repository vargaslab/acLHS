`aclhs` ([Huong et al., 20xx](https://github.com/vargaslab/acLHS)) implements the autocorrelated conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling algorithm for 1 dimensional (i.e., time-series) and 2 dimensional (i.e., spatial) data with independent and dependent variable values.

The latest stable version and development of `aclhs` is available at https://github.com/vargaslab/acLHS.
