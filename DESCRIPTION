Description: Implementation of the autocorrelated conditioned Latin
    Hypercube Sampling (acLHS) algorithm for 1D (time-series) and 2D (spatial)
    data. The acLHS algorithm is an extension of the conditioned Latin Hypercube 
    Sampling (cLHS) algorithm that allows samples to maintain correlative 
    features as well as statistical features. Only a properly formatted 
    dataframe needs to be provided to yield subsample indices from the package.
